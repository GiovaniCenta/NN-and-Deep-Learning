Reminder: The general methodology to build a Neural Network is to:

1. Define the neural network structure ( # of input units,  # of hidden units, etc). 
2. Initialize the model's parameters
3. Loop:
    - Implement forward propagation
    - Compute loss
    - Implement backward propagation to get the gradients
    - Update parameters (gradient descent)
